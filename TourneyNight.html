        <h1>Tournament Night at UHCL</h1>
        <div class="meta">By Caleb Huffman</br>April 18, 2025</div>
        <p>The Board Game Association along with the Gamer Guild and Hawk Gaming clubs, 
          hosted an event on campus called Tournament Night. Students could win prizes by
          competing against one another in video games or board games, the prizes ranged 
          from a board game bundle to a Meta Quest VR Headset. The event, which ran April 11
          from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., featured games like Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate 
          and Exploding Kittens. There were also snacks and drinks for those who came to the
          event; for those who wanted to participate, they also had controllers for the video
          games that you could rent. For more information about the clubs and future events you
          can join their GroupMe or visit their website. The Board Game Association places 
          flyers and sends out emails with information about how to join. </p>
