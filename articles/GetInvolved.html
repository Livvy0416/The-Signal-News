      <h1>Get Involved at UHCL</h1>
      <p><strong>By <a href="../authors/samuelfusaro.html">Samuel Fusaro</a></strong></p>
      <p><em>March 18, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        At the University of Houston Clear Lake there is always something fun happening right around the corner. The school strives to enrich the lives of its students by regularly holding events for students to engage in. The month of April is busy, so be sure to check out some of these upcoming events.</p>

        <p>Start UHCL kicked off April with our Service Week 2025. Service Week featured several events designed to draw students together to help our community. The week’s first event was a blood drive that ran from March 31 to April 1. The Volunteer Fair followed on April 2. Lastly, the Big Event, the largest one-day service project in the nation, will be taking place on April 5. This is the week for students with a love for giving back to our community to step up and get involved!</p>
        
        <p>The CAB’s Spring Thing happened on April 10. This fun celebration of UHCL school spirit welcomed everyone to attend. They shared live music, free food, and a chance to socialize with fellow students. The Board Game Association also took part, so there were games and entertainment enjoyed.</p>
        
        <p>The Hawk Excellence Awards took place on April 17. This event celebrates students and faculty who heavily contributed to student success during the year. The award ceremony is open to all members of the UHCL community, and there was a packed house.</p>
        
        <p>There’s still time to catch the last event for the month of April, Altitude: Neon Night. This is a special event put on by the Office of Student Involvement and Leadership. Neon Night is planned to be a high energy night of fun with arcade games, laser tag, mini-golf, glow in the dark crafts, music, and all the pizza you could eat. Join in for a night of fun on April 24.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, perhaps the most important events taking place this month are the Let’s Talk Tuesdays courtesy of the Counseling and Mental Health Center. Every Tuesday of this coming month there will be an opportunity to chat with mental health specialists in a casual environment. Let’s Talk Tuesdays will be held in the SSCB Lobby, and anyone is welcome to stop by for any reason. If you are interested in UHCL mental health programs, are concerned about a friend, or wish to have an informal conversation with a therapist please take some time to stop by. Mental health is vital for an enjoyable college experience, and UHCL is committed to ensuring the mental well-being of its students.</p>
        
        <p>            To stay up to date on interesting events, please stop by Get Involved! For more information visit the UHCL website for updates from the Office of Student Involvement and Leadership. <!-- trimmed for brevity -->
