      <h1>Protest at NASA over federal civil service terminations.</h1>
      <p><strong>By <a href="../authors/joshualister.html">Joshua Lister</a></strong></p>
      <p><em>March 17, 2025</em></p>

      <p>HOUSTON—A crowd gathered outside the main gate of NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center to protest the mass termination of federal employees. The protest was scheduled to last through the lunch period while traffic would be the heaviest.</p>

        <div class="article-text">
          <p>U.S. Rep. Al Green spoke at the event. Green is a Democrat representing Texas’ 9th district in Houston. Congressman Green was recently censured in the U.S. House of Representatives after speaking out during President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress, where he was escorted out of the House chamber by the sergeant-at-arms.</p>
          <p>Protestors assembled at the corner of NASA Parkway and Saturn Lane to raise awareness and critique mass terminations of civil servants across the government. The event was peaceful with no signs of hostility or counter-protests.</p>

        style="float: right; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" />
        <div class="article-text">
          <p>Alex, a protest organizer and union member, said the protest was scheduled to be a lunch-break rally. Alex, who asked not to have his last name used, went on to explain that he believes there is a misunderstanding in the country. According to Alex, people are angry because they imagine that government workers are lazy. “The people that work here are some of the hardest working people I’ve ever met in my entire life. Every single day they go to work, doing every single thing they can for the mission.”</p>
          <p>After several speeches by union leaders and Congressman Green, protesters lined the side of NASA Parkway to wave at cars passing and hold up signs showing their cause. Many cars honked and waved back to the protestors.</p>
          <p>In recent weeks, President Trump has laid off thousands of federal employees, most of whom were newer employees or employees still in their first-year probationary period. This project is being spearheaded by Elon Musk and the DOGE team. NASA has had an estimated 23 lay offs so far. Included in these lay offs was NASA’s chief scientist, whose position was eliminated. There are no published numbers for how many employees have been terminated to date, but a March 15 report by NPR (<em>Federal agencies plan for mass layoffs as Trump’s workforce cuts continue</em>, by Stephen Fowler) estimates tens of thousands have already lost their civil service jobs.</p>
